				<td>Hainanese chicken rice</td>
				<td>Hainanese chicken rice is a dish adapted from early Chinese immigrants originally from Hainan province in southern China.[1] It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore.[2] Hainanese chicken rice is most commonly associated with Singaporean, Malaysian and Hainanese cuisines, although it is also popular in Thailand, where it's known as Khao Man Gai, Vietnam and Indonesia. It is based on a well-known Hainanese dish called Wenchang chicken (文昌雞), due to its adoption by the Hainanese overseas Chinese population in the Nanyang area (present-day Southeast Asia). Catherine Ling of CNN describes Hainanese chicken rice as one of the "40 Singapore foods we can't live without".[3] It also listed at number 45 on World's 50 most delicious foods compiled by CNN Go in 2011.[4] In Malaysia, as in Singapore, chicken rice is available in many Chinese coffee shops, restaurants and street hawker stalls, and also in chain restaurants such as The Chicken Rice Shop and OldTown White Coffee.</td>

				<td>Roti prata</td>
				<td>Roti prata is a fried flatbread that is cooked over a flat grill. It is usually served with a vegetable- or meat-based curry. Prata is also commonly cooked with cheese, onion, banana, red bean, chocolate, mushroom or egg. In Malaysia, this dish is known as roti canai. Prata is technically the same as roti canai in Malaysia, but it is not to be confused with roti prata or paratha in Malaysia or South Asia.</td>
